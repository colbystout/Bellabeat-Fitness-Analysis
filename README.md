### Project Overview

In my premiere data analysis project, I was tasked with finding trends with fitbit data from 30 users. I needed to find certain trends between users, how those trends can help users be more active, and make recommendations for the marketing team to increase product engagement.

I used R as my primary tool for analysis. I began by importing data directly into my Kaggle notebook from the open Kaggle Fitbit dataset. I sifted out less useful dataframes and cleaned the date columns to prepare the dataframes for joins. After joining the datasets, I discovered many useful insights to make recommendations to the marketing team using R visualizations.
